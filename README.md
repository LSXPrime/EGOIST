## Overview
A project that aims to simplify interaction with various AI models across different types such as voice, text, and image generation for the end user. It seeks to combine the majority of these features into a single tool, thereby saving storage and reducing the complexity involved in setting up separate tools for each task, achieved through automation.

## Getting Started

1. Install .NET 7 runtime & CUDA Toolkit 11.8 (for GPU Inference only) and Python 3.10.6 .
2. Proceed by either downloading the latest release and executing it or cloning the repository. 
3. Launch the backend by clicking the "Start Backend" button in the settings (This step is necessary only for TTS & voice cloning tasks).

> If you opt to clone the repository and compile it manually, make sure that the necessary dependencies are installed and configured. You have the option to compile it using Visual Studio 2022 or via `dotnet build`.
